## Description
This is a command line multi-player trivia game. Players will have the opportunity to join a room with their friend, choose a category of trivia questions, and play against each other towards a winner with a high score. There are 10 questions per category and you'll have a maximum of **20** seconds to choose, unless your opponent answers correctly first! One player will win with a high score and you'll have the ability to return to the lobby and play another round.
